# NBAStats

## What is it

**NBAStats** is a   NBA Stats Application in development. It scrapes NBA player
and team data from http://www.basketball-reference.com/ using Python.
Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries are used to visually represent this data.

First, I plotted Win Shares per 48 minutes for all draft picks grouped by the year they were drafted (1996-2016).

I used that plot to compare the WS per 48 to only the first round picks in those same draft years. This data shows what I expected which was that first round picks are more likely to be successful in the NBA. This is due to their talent allowing them to make a more positive impact on the game and it is more probable that they have longer NBA careers.
